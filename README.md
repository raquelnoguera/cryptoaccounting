# Crypto Accounting

This is a small project that I have done to get the current value of a 
crypto investment portfolio.

Currently, all the tokens shall be listed in the ***"tokens.json*** file
in the root folder. This python script will only retrieve the value of 
the tokes listed there.

In the future, I want to read the portfolio of tokens for the different 
chains from the wallet address and use the ***tokens.json*** only as a
fallback or for tokens in blockchains that are not supported by this 
script.
